** Deciding between Rival Hypothesis
# Conceptually speaking a deliberately contrived experiment can be
# effective to evaluate a single hypothesis which entails a testable
# prediction against a background of fixed theory.

# In real sciences, hypotheses are usually tested in pairs, the one
# conceived as a rival to the other.

# Obviously, a truth of consequences does not prove the truth of the
# hypothesis from which it follows, though the rival is eliminated as
# false. Successful experiments still leave open the possibility for
# further revision.

*** Robert Boyle: /The Measurement of the Spring of the Air/
# Robert Boyle, Ireland, grew up in considerable affluence. Studies in
# Eaton, Geneva where he decided to devote himself to science. While
# watching a spectacular display of lightnings and wondering why he
# was not stroke, he came to the conclusion God must have reserved him
# for some special task. Self dedication to demonstrate God's majesty
# by unravelling the secrets of nature.
# Moved to Italy where he studied Galileo's work, came back to England
# because of the civil war and was encouraged to study medicine and
# hence got interested in chemistry while preparing drugs.
# With Robert Hooke, they used a Torricellian tube.
# - The greater the weight is, the more forcible is its endeavour of
#   dilation 
# - At this point the tube broke
# - What would be the effect of heating or cooling the trapped air ?
# - it sometimes seemed a little to shrink but not so manifestly tha
#   we dare build anything upon it. However when the cautiously heated
#   the closed end with a candle flame, the heat had a more sensible
#   operation.

*The study of gases priori to Boyle*
- Nature and even the possibility of the \textit{vacuum}.
  # Toriccelli artificially created vacuum. Then why is it so unstable
  # and is there a tendency to fill empty spaces.
  # Boyle thought it was due to the very expensive nature of the air
  #+LaTeX: \item<2-> Boyle thought it was due to the very expensive nature of the air: $P\times\only<2>{V}\only<3>{(V-a)} = constant$ \only<3>{(by Amagat in 1899)}

  \small\it I shall not venture to determine whether or no the intimated theory
  will hold universally and precisely [...] No one perhaps yet knows
  how near to an infinite compression the air may be capable of, if
  the compressing force can be competently increased.
** The use of Models to Simulate otherwise Unsearchable Processes
*** Theodoric of Freibourg: /The causes of the Rainbow/
# Theodoric, Germany a little before 1250. Member of the Dominican
# Order. Religious orders were not inclined to encourage individuals
# to pursuer privat interests. This may account for Theodoric's
# apparent reticence for publishing his researches. He was encouraged
# by the master of the order to make a systematic study of the
# rainbow.  Although much of medieval science was a mere repetition of
# material derived in a large part from the work of Aristotle, there
# was a good deal of the highest work here and there. Theodoric's work
# is among the most impressive. 
# He gave up teacching in later life to devote hmself to Church ministry.
# He used water-filled urine flasks. Drops are falling so rapidly that
# they can be thought to be replacing each so rapidly that they are
# equivalent to a stationnary curtain of globes.
# Mistake in the computation of the elevation angle (22° instead of
# 42°). Serious error in drawing the sun roughly at the same distance
# as the observer.
- How are colours formed and why are they always in the same order?
- Why does it have such a unvarying geometrical form?

*The state of rainbow studies before Theodoric*
- /Meteorologica/ by Aristotle: due to *reflection* from newly formed
  raindrops which form a better mirror than mist
- Reflection of the circular disc of the sun\medskip \pause

** Exploiting an Accident
*** Louis Pasteur: /The preparation of Artificial Vaccines/
# Jura in 1822. Son of a tanneur, rated as an indefferent pupil but
# ambitious for recognition and determined to acquire it by hard
# work. Difficulties for entering the Hautes Écoles in Paris but
# finally entered the Ecole Normale where he was even appointed as an
# assistant in 1847 after his aggregation and doctorate and even
# director in 1857.
#
# Early work in crystallography but interested in biology, convinced
# that asymmetry and life were connected manifestations. Came to the
# germ theory by generalizing that a yeast was necessary to all
# fermentation.
#
# Already existing vaccine for smallpox by Jenner.  Epidemics came and
# went. Diseases were more or less severe but Paster had realized that
# different cultures of had different virulence. 
#
# Studied chicken cholera for which a characteristic microbe in the
# blood of infected chickens was already identified. Used chicken
# broth as a medium to cultivate the microbe. After returning from
# vacation, he resumed his experiments by injecting the old broth but
# nothing happened.When reinfecting the same hen with a fresh culture,
# they did not develop the disease.
# 
# For interval of over a month between reseeding, there is no
# attenuation but afte that, the longer the gap the greater the
# attenuation. Sealed some tubes with low oxygen. OK but still no real
# explanation (no difference in the eye working through a microscope).
#
# The attenuated form can be obtained from the very virulent one
# although the fundamental nature of each is the same.
#
# From the biology point of view of the micro-organisms, the host is
# just another environment (no diff between the host and the
# broth). Finding the right medium and how to let it attenuate is
# very tricky.


*Disease theory before Pasteur*
- van Helmont (1626) proposed that diseases should be looked as the
  effect of an invasion of the body by an army of alien beings
  (/archae/) that produced poisonous waste
- Popular belief: malfunctions of the diseased organism, bad smells
  cause diseases, observed microbes were considered as side-effect \medskip
