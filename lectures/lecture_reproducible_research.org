*** A few Words on Scientific Foundation
- *Falsifiability* or *refutability* of a statement, hypothesis, or
  theory is an inherent possibility to prove it to be false (not
  "/commit fraud/" but "/prove to be false/").
- Karl Popper makes falsifiability the demarcation criterion to
  *distinguish the scientific from the unscientific*

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It is not only not right, it is not even wrong!

  -- Wolfgang Pauli
  #+END_QUOTE
- Theories cannot be proved correct but they can be disproved. Only a
  few stand the test of batteries of *critical experiments*.
- It is not all black and white. There are many stories where
  scientists stick with their theories despite evidences and
  sometimes, they were even right to do so...
#+BEGIN_CENTER
  *Testing and checking is thus one of the basis of science*

- A recent scandal ::
  In 2013, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong-Pyou_Han][/Dong-Pyou Han/]], a former assistant professor of biomedical
     sciences at Iowa State University was disgraced:\footnotesize
  - Falsified blood results to make it appear as though a vaccine he was
    working on had exhibited anti-HIV activity
  - Han and his team received 
    #+LaTeX: $\approx \$19$ million from NIH
  - Retraction and resignation of university
  - Han was sentenced in 2015 to 57 months imprisonment for
    fabricating and falsifying data in HIV vaccine trials. He was also
    fined US 
    #+LaTeX: $\$7.2$ million!
- \normalsize We should avoid witch-hunt :: 
  #+LaTeX: ~\footnotesize
  - August 5, 2014, Yoshiki Sasai (stem cell, considered for Nobel
    Prize) hanged in his laboratory at the RIKEN
    (Japan). Fraud suspicion...
  - In 1986, a young postdoctoral fellow at MIT accused her director,
    Thereza Imanishi-Kari, of falsifying the results of a study
    published in Cell and co-signed by the Nobel laureate David
    Baltimore. [..] Declared guilty, Univ. presidency resignation, and
    finally cleared. This put the careers of two outstanding
    researchers on hold for ten years based on unfounded accusations.
- \normalsize Scientific fraud is bad but let's be careful :: \footnotesize Have a look at the
     wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academic_scandals][/list of academic scandals/]]. On a totally different
     aspect, do not forget to also have a look at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism][/plagiarism/]] and

*** My Feeling                                                   :noexport:
Computer scientists have an incredibly *poor training in
probabilities, statistics, experiment management*
  
\medskip

Why should we? Computer are *deterministic* machines after all, right?
;)

\medskip

Ten years ago, I've started realizing how *lame* the articles I
reviewed (as well as those I wrote) were in term of experimental
methodology.
+ Yeah, I know, your method/algorithm is better than the others as
  demonstrated by the figures
+ Not enough information to *discriminate real effects from noise*
+ Little information about the *workload*
+ Would the ``conclusion'' still hold with a slightly different
  workload?
+ I'm tired of awful combination of tools (perl, gnuplot, sql, ...)
  and *bad methodology*
*** Common practice in CS                                        :noexport:
\small
Computer scientists tend to either:
- vary *one factor at a time*, use a very fine sampling of the
  parameter range,
- *run millions of experiments* for a week varying a lot of
  parameters and then try to get something of it. Most of the time,
  they (1) don’t know how to analyze the results (2) realize
  something went wrong...

  \begin{block}{}Interestingly, most other scientists do \structure{the exact

#+END_LaTeX

These two flaws come from poor training and from the fact that C.S.
experiments are *almost* free and very fast to conduct
- Most strategies of experimentation (DoE) have been designed to
  *provide sound answers despite* all the *randomness and
  uncontrollable factors*
- *Maximize the amount of information* provided by a given set of
  experiments
- *Reduce* as much as possible *the number of experiments* to perform
  to answer a given question under a given level of confidence

#+LaTeX: \hspace{-2cm}\includegraphics[width=1.4\linewidth]{fig/author_reader_rr_4.fig}
*** 3. Logging and backup your data
What are the options?
- Nothing $\frowny$ (remember the funny examples from the beginning... \winkey)
- Incremental backup mechanisms (e.g., time machine)
- The cloud! (e.g., Dropbox and Google Drive $\frowny$ ...)
- Flexible version control systems (e.g. git $\smiley$) where you're in
  control of what's happening
  - Use a crontab if you really do not want to think about it
  - We have come up with a specific [[https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01112795/document][git branching workflow]] for
    managing experimental results
*** 4. Organizing and managing your data
- Use the machine readable *CSV format*
- Provide *raw* data and *meta* data, not just statistical outputs
- Organization
  - Explain your conventions (e.g., =src/=, =data/=, =script/=, =journal.org=)
  - Git submodules
- *Never* do data manipulation and statistical tests *by hand* or with a
  *spreadsheet* $\frowny$
- *Use R*, Python or another free software to read and process raw
  data.
  - Use a workflow that *documents both data and process*
  - The org-mode tangling mechanism may help
*** 5. Mastering your environment
What are the options?
- Nothing \winkey No, it's not, you have to do something...
- _Restrict your tools/dependencies_ to the bare minimum (e.g., python)
  - List them all manually in a README
  - Use [[https://github.com/inria-traces/trace.archive/blob/master/src/capture_metadata.sh][custom shell scripts]] or [[http://sos.readthedocs.org/][=sosreport=]] that _log all the
    dependencies you are aware_. Ask your friends to check whether this
    is sufficient...
  - Combine everything in [[http://www.activepapers.org/][/activepapers/]], i.e., an HDFS5 file
    combining datasets and programs working on these datasets in a
    single package, along with meta data, history, ...
- Create and distribute your own _virtual image_ (VM, docker,
  [[http://gmkurtzer.github.io/singularity/][Singularity]])
- Have tools that *automatically* keep track of dependencies/files
  and packages up the Code, Data, and Environment 
  - [[http://www.pgbovine.net/cde.html][CDE]] (Guo et al., 2011) [[https://vida-nyu.github.io/reprozip/][ReproZip]] (Freire et al., 2013), [[http://reproducible.io/][CARE]] (Janin
    et al., 2014), 
  - See [[http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/research/papers/techniques-ipres-2015.pdf][Preserve the Mess or Encourage Cleanliness?]] (Thain et al., 2015)
- Use a specific tool to _generate customized *appliances*_ (kvm, LXC,
  Virtualbox, iso, ...): *recipes* with *steps* and *aliases*, execution in
  *contexts*, *checkpoints*, ... ([[http://kameleon.imag.fr/][/Kameleon/]])
*** 6. Controlling your experiments
- Naive way: sh + ssh + ... 
- Better way: use a *workflow management system* ([[http://www.taverna.org.uk/][taverna]], [[https://galaxyproject.org/][galaxy]],
  [[https://kepler-project.org/][kepler]], [[http://www.vistrails.org/][vistrails]], ...)

Here are the following important features to exploit:
- Structure :: highly hierarchical
  - Sectioning, itemize, enumerate, fonts
  - Tags to control what will be exported
- Export :: in several output formats
  - Fine control with =#+BEGIN_LaTeX=
  - Unfortunate need for verbose headers (because of \LaTeX $\frowny$) and
    black magic in the end of the file (for emacs portability $\frowny$)
- Babel :: (the literate programming part of org-mode). Many possible
     usage:
  - Run babel on export
  - Or not... and make sure intermediate results are stored (this is
    how I proceed)
  - Dependencies can be expressed
  - Caching mechanism
  - Side effects are the enemy of reproducibility

*** 2. Logging your activity \qquad (Laboratory Notebook)
_Do not tie your hands with non-free software like Evernote or OneNote_

\small
# - [[http://jupyter.org/][Ipython/Jupyter]] notebook like in Mathematica
- [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] again!
  - Capture mechanism (notes, todo, ...)
  - Babel favors code reuse, ssh connections in sessions,
    meta-programming
  - Tagging mechanism to structure the journal
  - Link mechanism, Todo, Calendar views, Tables, ...
