* Reporting Results
** An IMRAD Report
*** Structure
Research articles are often structured in this basic order:
- Introduction ::  Why was the study undertaken? What was the research
                   question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of
                   the research?
- Methods :: When, where, and how was the study done? What
             materials/hardware were used? How was it configured?
- Results :: What answer was found to the research question; what did
             the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true? *Present
             useful results in a synthetic way with a logical order*.
- Discussion :: What might the answer imply and why does it matter?
                How does it fit in with what other researchers have
                found? What are the possible bias and points to
                improve? What are the perspectives for future
                research?

Such structure *facilitates literature review* and is a very effective
way to convey information.

If the report is a few pages long then *an abstract is required*.
** Good Practice for Setting up a Laboratory Notebook
*** Step 0: Taking Notes
*Document* your:
+ *Hypotheses*: keep track of your ideas/line of thoughts
+ *Experiments*: details on how and why an experiment was run, including
  failed or ambiguous attempts.
+ *Initial analysis or interpretation* of these experiments: was the
  outcome conform to the expectation or not? does it (in)validate the
  hypothesis?
+ *Organization*: keep track of things to do/fix/test/improve

*Structure*:
1. General information about the document and organization *conventions*
   (e.g., directory structure, notebook structure, experimental result
   storing mechanism, ...)
2. Documentation of *commonly used commands* and of how to set up
   experiments (e.g., git cloning, environment deployment, connection
   to machines, compiling scripts)
3. Experiment results can be either structured *by dates* ($\leadsto$ add
   tags) or *by experiment campaigns* ($\leadsto$ add date/time)
*** Which format should I use ?
- *Wikis* are encouraged to favor collaboration but I do not find them
  really effective
- *Blogging* systems are also a way of managing such notebook but they
  should rather be considered as an effective way to share information
  with others
- I recommend to use basic *plain-text* format and to *structure it
  hierarchically*
  #+BEGIN_CENTER 
  Here is a *[[http://starpu-simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/misc/LabBook.html\#sec-8-1][link]]* to an excerpt of the journal of one of my PhD
  student, managed with git/org-mode. More detailed links are given in
  #+LaTeX: slide~\ref{orglabref}.

Last but not least:

Provide links to *Raw Data*!!!

*** When/How Often Should I Use it?
I have a very intense usage (demo to *[[file:~/org/journal.org][general journal]]* and specific
*[[file:~/Work/Documents/Articles/2013/2013_boinc_response_time_optimization/journal.org][BOINC journal]]*) and I tend to capture a lot of information but you do
not have to be as extreme as I am. Here are a few advices:

- Spending *more than an hour without* at least *writing* what you're
  working on *is not right*...
  + *Take a 5 minutes* break and ask yourself what you're doing, what is
    keeping you busy and where all this is leading you
- While working on something, you will often notice/think about
  something you should fix/improve but you just don't want to do it
  now. Take 20 seconds to write a *TODO* entry.
- There are moments where you have to *wait for something* (compiling,
  deployment, ...). It is generally the perfect time for improving
  your notes (e.g., detail the steps to accomplish a TODO entry).
- *By the end of the day*: daily (and weekly) *review!*
  - Update your lists, write what the next steps are
  - *Summarize in a 2-4 lines* (for your advisor) what you did, what was
    difficult, what you learnt.
*** Step 1: Sharing Code and Data
#+LaTeX: \begin{overlayarea}{\linewidth}{7.6cm}\null\vspace{-.6cm}
#+LaTeX: \begin{block}{What kinds of systems are available?}
- "Good" - The cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, *Figshare*)
- *Better* - Version control systems (SVN, *Git* and Mercurial)
- "Best" - Version control systems on the cloud (GitHub, Bitbucket)

Depends on the level of privacy you expect but you probably already
know these tools. 
#+LaTeX: \hfill\textbf{\bf Few handle GB files}...\hfill\null
#+LaTeX: \end{block}\begin{block}{Is this enough?}
1. Use a workflow that *documents both data and process*
2. Use the machine readable *CSV format*
3. Provide *raw* data and *meta* data, not just statistical outputs
4. *Never* do data manipulation and statistical tests *by hand*
5. *Use R*, Python or another free software to read and process raw
   data (*ideally* to *produce complete reports* with code, results
   and prose)

*** Step 2: Literate Programming
\small
*Donald Knuth*: explanation of the program logic in a *natural language*
*interspersed with snippets of* macros and traditional *source code*.

#+BEGIN_CENTER
I'm way too =3l33t= to program this way but that's \\
*exactly what we need for writing a reproducible article/analysis!*

**** Org-mode (requires emacs)
My favorite tool.
- plain text, very smooth, works both for html, pdf, ...
- allows to combine all my favorite languages even with sessions
**** Ipython notebook
If you are a python user, go for it! Web app, easy to use/setup...
**** KnitR (a.k.a. Sweave)
For non-emacs users and as a first step toward /reproducible papers/:
- Click and play with a modern IDE (e.g., Rstudio)

*** Literate Programming on a Daily Basis
**** Mastering Emacs
- =C-g=: get me out of here!
- =C-_=: undo
- Activate CUA keys in the Options menu
**** Mastering Org-mode
- =Tab= will fold/unfold stuff
- =C-c C-c=: do something (context-sensitive) where you are
- =<s= + =Tab=, =<b=, =<l=, =<r=, =<h=, ... for *creating code blocks*
- =C-c C-e=: *export*
- =C-c c=: *capture content*
- =C-c C-o= / =C-c l= / =C-c C-l=: open/store/insert *links*
- =C-c C-a=: *attach* a file
- =C-c C-d=: set deadline, =C-c C-t=: TODO/DONE

*** Emacs/Org-mode Recap
#+LaTeX: \label{orglabref}

**** Key features
- Plain text makes it *very robust* and *human readable*
- Allow to *mix any language* and has a notion of session that makes its
  use very effective
- Allow to produce both =html documents=, classical \LaTeX articles,
  \textsc{beamer} slides, =odt= documents, ... Native *pretty printing* on Github
