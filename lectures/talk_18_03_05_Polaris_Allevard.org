*** Common beliefs
- /RR mainly allows to fight scientific misconduct (e.g.,
  fraud). That's nice but I'm honnest so just let me do my work!/
  \medskip\pause
- /RR is all about re-executing the same code, even if the code is
  stupid and makes wrong computation. It's pointless!/ \medskip\pause
- /My student has done everything with org-jupyter-studio-mode./
  /Now he's gone and I can't reuse what he did. See, what's the point?
  RR does not help!/ \medskip\pause
- /RR is about controling and checking everything, which slows down the
  scientific discovery process./ /Changing the way we work and publish
  may be harmful!/
*** Why did I get interested in this in the first place ?

*Frustration* as an author, a reviewer, a scientist
- The damned fourth reviewer asked for a major revision and wants me
  to *change figure 3*. $\frowny$ *Which code* and *which data set* did I use to
  generate this figure?
- 6 months later: *Why* did I do that?
- There is no label/legend/... What is the *meaning of this graph*?  If
  only I could access the generation script and get rid of the logscale
- This *average value* must hide something. As usual, no *confidence
  interval*\dots I wonder whether the difference is *significant* at all
- How does this really work ? It this improvement *solely the result of
  this naive idea*?

/Is your Frustration really a good motivation for annoying everyone
else?/

*** A recent story
\textbf{February 2018}: /could you have a look at this article for a
review?/
#+BEGIN_CENTER
  *The Pitfalls of Provisioning Exascale Networks: A Trace Replay
  Analysis for Understanding Communication Performance*
#+END_CENTER
UQ and HPC simulation! Exactly what I'm interested in at the
moment!\pause\bigskip

Wait, I obviously know who wrote this. \textbf{Flashback:}
- June 2013: *Validation and Uncertainty Assessment of Extreme-Scale
  HPC Simulation through Bayesian Inference* (EuroPar)
- October 2016: Dagstuhl seminar on UQ and HPC. Explanations from
  Habib Najm, a UQ expert! $\smiley$

\pause\bigskip
\textbf{Back to 2018}:
- Same vague (but convincing!) explanations, still no code, just as
  useless to me as 4.5 years ago
- There is no scientific misconduct at all. Yet, it is useless.
  - none of the other reviewer complained about this
  - why would the authors bother? (/researchware/)
*** (For me) RR = \textbf{sharing} research results

Wait, I thought this is what conferences and articles were about! :)

#+BEGIN_CENTER
*The five R's of RR*: Re-Run, Repeat, Reproduce, Replicate, _Reuse_
#+END_CENTER
Many technical aspects:
- software/environment engineering, preservation, and continuous
  integration
- numerical aspects
- experimental aspect (measure, statistics)
- provenance tracking and information/code/data sharing 

In my case: allow informed inspection
#+BEGIN_CENTER
  The *laboratory notebook* and *a better understanding of statistics* are
  essential
#+END_CENTER
*** What can I do to change all this ?
- [[https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE][SMPE lecture]] (CS master students)
- Keynotes (mostly toward computer scientists, PhD, postdocs, ...)
  - even at the Inria Scientific Days in 2016
- [[https://github.com/alegrand/RR_webinars/][Webinars]]
- Program committees in conferences
  - Should I sign the [[https://opennessinitiative.org/][PRO]] manifesto ? https://opennessinitiative.org/
  - [[http://reppar.org/][RepPar]] but now many "competing" workshops
- Inria strategical plan: 1 out of 21 is on RR
- [[https://github.com/alegrand/RR_MOOC/][MOOC]]: in June on FUN ?
  - a much larger target audience, hence teach the basics
  - journaling, literate programming, simple provenance tracking/backup
- Keynote for DGD-T Inria (SED and STIP engineers) in May 2018
- HRS4R: 1st meeting in March 2018
\bigskip

I'm glad to do this but this is exhausting $\frowny$
*** Does RR qualify for scientific research by the way ?

Knowing about all these tools definitely allows me to improve my
research. Is this enough ?
- RR is mentioned in the POLARIS proposal as a transverse activity,
  not as a research axis.
- *Epistemic opacity*: is it a scientific question or a social problem?
- Will it be solved all by itself ? Are *we* really doing RR ourselves ?
  Do we care ?

   \textbf{Any thoughts ?}
