* Course Objective and Organization
The aim of this course is to provide the fundamental basis for sound
scientific methodology of empirical evaluation of computer
systems. This lecture emphasize on methodological aspects of
measurement and on the statistics needed to analyze computer systems,  human-computer interaction systems, and machine learning systems.
We first sensibilize the audience to the experiment and analysis
reproducibility issue in particular in computer science. Then we
present tools that help answering the analysis problem and may also
reveal useful for managing the experimental process through
notebooks. The audience is given the basis of probabilities and
statistics required to develop sound experiment designs. The content of the lecture is therefore both theoretical and practical, illustrated by a lot of case studies and practical sessions. The goal is not to provide analysis recipes that people
can readily apply but to make students really understand some simple
(and possibly not-so-simple) tools so that they can then dig deeper later on.

You may want to look at the [[file:../2021_10_Grenoble/README.org][previous edition]] to see the kind of material we use but we will adapt to the audience on the fly anyway.

All the examples given in this series of lecture use the [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] language
and the source is provided so that people can reuse them. The slides
are composed with [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]], beamer, and verbments.

2. 2. Hands on in group on one of the following example:
   - Parallel Quicksort: Fork this small [[https://github.com/alegrand/M2R-ParallelQuicksort][project]] which is toy experiment regarding measuring the performance of a simple parallel quicksort implementation:
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       One of your colleague just implemented a multi-threaded version of
       the quicksort algorithm for multi-core machines. He's convinced his
       code can save significant time saving but unfortunately, he did not
       follow the performance evaluation lecture and he would like your
       help to promote his code.
     #+END_QUOTE
     Try to re-run this code, compare the results, improve the experimental design if needed..
   - Empirical evaluation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law][Fitts's law]]: Fork this small [[https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/coutrixc/m2r_pointingxp][project]]
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Fitts described 1954 the relationship between the distance to a target, its width, and the time needed to acquire it [Fitts, 1954]. To aquire a target, e.g., to move the mouse cursor and click on a file to select it, Fitts' law describes how the distance between the start point and the target (A: amplitude of the movement), and the size of the target (W: width of the target) impacts the index of difficulty of the task (ID) [MacKenzie and Buxton, 1992]:

        ID = log2(A/W + 1)

     The time (MT: movement time) needed for a user to acquire a target is linearly correlated to ID:

         MT = a + b × ID

     A large part of Human-Computer Interaction research since then builds on top of Fitts' law. This project aims at finding the values of the a and b parameters.
     #+END_QUOTE
     Try to re-run this analysis, then re-obtain some data and compare the results, improve the experimental design if needed.
3. If time allows, [[http://polaris.imag.fr/arnaud.legrand/teaching/2011/EP_02_Measurements.pdf][short general lecture on measurement]] or

*** Homeworks
- [ ] Write an in-depth report using a computational document with a decent data management/statistical treatment (i.e., with confidence intervals or regions!). You have two options:
  - Use the quicksort or the Fitt's law hands on. 
    - Formally state the question, identify parameters, propose an evaluation protocol with at least two configurations, perform a proper statistical analysis, provide interpretations and conclude if it is possible. It you cannot conclude, explain why. In any case discuss possible further investigations.
  - Pick one of the seven subjects proposed in the peer evaluation of the MOOC. Subject 2 is too easy and is not an option.

** 02/02/24 Exam:
* Hands-on
In the 3rd module of the [[https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/recherche-reproductible-principes-methodologiques-pour-une-science-transparente/][MOOC on Reproducible Research]], there is a
peer-reviewed homework that will allow you to practically use
everything you learnt. 
* Requirements 
All the examples given in this series of lecture use the [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] language
and the source is provided so that people can reuse them. The slides
are composed with [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]], beamer, and verbments.

It is not expected that students already knows the R language as I
will briefly present it. However, they should have already installed
Rstudio and R (check the next section if you need information) on
their laptop so as to try out the examples I provide for themselves. 

Alternatively, you may use Jupyter with python or R, either on your
machine or through the MOOC or the [[https://jupyterhub.u-ga.fr/][UGA JupyterHub]]. Most R verbs have
now their python counterpart (e.g., =numpy= and =pandas= for vectors and
dataframes, =plotnine= for =ggplot2=, =statsmodels= for linear regressions,
...).
* Using R
** Installing R, Rstudio, or Jupyter
*** R
Here is how to proceed on debian-based distributions:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt install r-base r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-dplyr r-cran-tidyr r-cran-knitr r-cran-magrittr 
#+END_SRC
Make sure you have a recent (>= 3.2.0) version or R. For example, here
is what I have on my machine:
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
R --version
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) -- "Kick Things"
Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

GNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.

https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

#+end_example
*** Rstudio
Rstudio and knitr are unfortunately not packaged within debian so the
easiest is to download the corresponding debian package on the [[http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop][Rstudio
webpage]] and then to install it manually (depending on when you do this
and on the version of your OS, *you should obviously change the version
number*).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/bionic/amd64/rstudio-2021.09.0%2B351-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i rstudio-2021.09.0+351-amd64.deb
sudo apt -f install # to fix possibly missing dependencies
#+END_SRC
# You will also need to install knitr. To this end, you should simply
# run R (or Rstudio) and use the following command.
# #+BEGIN_SRC R
# install.packages("knitr")
# #+END_SRC
If some packages like =r-cran-ggplot2= or =r-cran-reshape= could not be installed for some
reason, you can also install it through R by doing:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("ggplot2")
#+END_SRC
*** Jupyter
Now regarding jupyter, here is how to proceed on a debian-based distribution:
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install jupyter r-cran-irkernel r-cran-irdisplay
#+end_src
Then you can simply run:
#+begin_src sh
jupyter notebook
#+end_src

If you want a cooler Jupyter environment, [[https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html][install JupyterLab]], for example as follows:
#+begin_src sh
pip3 install jupyterlab
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME
jupyter lab
#+end_src

** Producing documents
The easiest way to go is probably to [[http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown][use R+Markdown (Rmd files) in
Rstudio]] and to export them via [[http://www.rpubs.com/][Rpubs]] to make available [[http://www.rpubs.com/tucano/zombies][whatever you
want]].

We can roughly distinguish between three kinds of documents:
1. Lab notebook (with everything you try and that is meant mainly
   for yourself)
2. Experimental report (selected results and explanations with
   enough details to discuss with your advisor)
3. Result description (rather short with only the main point and,
   which could be embedded in an article)
We expect you to provide us the last two ones and to make them
publicly available so as to allow others to [[http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/ratmog11][comment]] on them.
** Learning R
For a quick start, you may want to look at [[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf][R for Beginners]]. A probably
more entertaining way to go is to follow a good online lecture
providing an introduction to R and to data analysis such as this one:
https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata. 

A quite effective way (if you have time) is to use [[http://swirlstats.com/students.html][SWIRL]], an
interactive learning environment that will guide through self-paced
lesson.
#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
install_from_swirl("R Programming")
swirl()
#+end_src
I suggest in particular to follow the following lessons from R
programming (max 10 minutes each):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 1: Basic Building Blocks      2: Workspace and Files     
 3: Sequences of Numbers       4: Vectors                 
 5: Missing Values             6: Subsetting Vectors      
 7: Matrices and Data Frames   8: Logic                   
 9: Functions                 12: Looking at Data         
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, you may want to read this [[http://ww2.coastal.edu/kingw/statistics/R-tutorials/dataframes.html][excellent tutorial on data frames]]
(=attach=, =with=, =rownames=, =dimnames=, notions of scope...).
** Learning the tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyR)
All these packages have been developed by hadley wickam and are gathered [[https://www.tidyverse.org/][here]]. There are amazing cheatsheets you may want to refer to.
