```{r}
hist(runif(10000, min = 0 , max = 1))
```

```{r}
hist(rexp(10000, rate = 1))
```

```{r}
N = 100000
mean(runif(N, min = 0 , max = 2))
mean(rexp(N, rate = 1))
```
What if everyone of us makes 30 measurements and estimates the expectation through the sample mean?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
rep = 1000
N = 30
df = data.frame(obs = rexp(N*rep, rate = 1), id = 1:rep)
head(df)
tail(df)
```

```{r}
df %>% group_by(id) %>% summarise(obs= mean(obs)) %>%
   ggplot(aes(x=obs)) + geom_histogram() + xlim(0,2)
```
