* Survey at the beginning of the lecture

** Answers
*** Participation
There was about 40 students officially enrolled and much more on the
first day. 56 peopled started filling the survey but in the end, only
*49 actually completed* it. All the ones who started and did not
complete actually didn't provide any answer in the form so it was
probably a technical mistake.
*** Student's position

Damned limesurvey CSV export. There is an empty value that could be
Software or Research engineer, Full-time professor or Post-doc!
Unbelievable. That's sufficient to have an idea any way.
*** Research Domain
[[file:pdf_babel/ufrgs2.png]]

Here is a zoom on the most common ones
[[file:pdf_babel/ufrgs3.png]]

Here is the decoding:
| AI | Artificial Intelligence        |
| CV | Computer Vision                |
| DS | Data Structures and algorithms |
| DC | Distributed Computing and HPC  |
| GR | GRaphics                       |
| AR | ARchitecture                   |
| HC | Human Computer Interaction     |
| LG | Machine Learning               |
| PF | Performance                    |

*** Coding languages
[[file:pdf_babel/ufrgs4.png]]

The range is from 0 (knows nothing/never heard of it) to 5 (expert)
*** OS used for daily work
[[file:pdf_babel/ufrgs5.png]]

Here LinuxEdge means a very recent distribution, possibly testing or unstable.
*** Typesetting tools
[[file:pdf_babel/ufrgs6.png]]

0 means "never heard about it", 1 means "trying not to use it" and 5
means "used it a lot and knows how to trick it".
*** Analysis tools
[[file:pdf_babel/ufrgs7.png]]

Same legend as before
*** Theoretical skills
[[file:pdf_babel/ufrgs8.png]]

0 means "never heard about it" while 5 means "fully understanding the
notion and possible limits".

It would be fun to correlate these answers as well as those on tools
and languages to research areas.
