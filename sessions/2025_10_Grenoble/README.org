* Course Objective and Organization
The aim of this course is to provide the fundamental basis for sound
scientific methodology of empirical evaluation of computer
systems. This lecture emphasize on methodological aspects of
measurement and on the statistics needed to analyze computer systems
(note that most our discussions also apply to e.g., human-computer
interaction systems or machine learning systems).  We first
sensibilize the audience to the experiment and analysis
reproducibility issue in particular in computer science. Then we
present tools that help answering the analysis problem and may also
reveal useful for managing the experimental process through
notebooks. The audience is given the basis of probabilities and
statistics required to develop sound experiment designs. Finally, we
address "meta-science" question such as how scientific knowledge is
built, what is the role of publications, scientific integrity and
ethic issues.

The content of the lecture is therefore both theoretical and
practical, illustrated by a lot of case studies and practical
sessions. The goal is not to provide analysis recipes that people can
readily apply but to make students really understand some simple (and
possibly not-so-simple) tools so that they can then dig deeper later
on.

You may want to look at the [[file:../2024_10_Grenoble/README.org][previous edition]] (, which was given to a
broader audience with twice more time). to see the kind of material we
use but we will adapt to the audience on the fly anyway. 

All the examples given in this series of lecture use the [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] language
and the source is provided so that people can reuse them. The slides
are composed with [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]], beamer, and verbments.

Evaluation process:
  - *Final exam (3 hours): 1/2*
  - *Continuous assessment: 1/2*
* Prerequisite
- Familiarity with the use of a computational notebook (Jupyter, R, org-mode, …)
- Familiarity with the use of Git/GitLab/GitHub
- Having already failed in properly conducting experiments and reaching a sound conclusion
- All the examples given in this series of lecture use the R language as it is more appropriate than Python for this kind of work but every important concept will be introduced and resources will be provided to allow students to quickly level up.
* Targeted skills
- Working in a fully transparent (journal, version tracking, archiving, …), rigorous, and controlled (experiment design, software environment) way
- Fluency with modern data analysis frameworks such as the [[https://www.tidyverse.org/)][Tidyverse]] (in particular [[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/][ggplot2]] and [[https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/][dplyr]]).
- Criticizing (and proposing improvements):
  - the experimental protocol and its shortcomings;
  - the quality of the data;
  - the graphical representation of experimental results presented in slides or articles;
  - the proposed data analysis and conclusion reached;
- Criticizing and improving the research question.

Here are the topics that are typically covered during the lecture.

- Epistemology of computer science
  - Computer Science is an Experimental Science: Randomness is unavoidable whenever human beings are involved but can also not be ignored anymore given the complexity of modern computer systems (network, cpus, hardware/software stack) or when working in a machine learning context which relies on observational data and remains empirical.
  - Science is defined by its method, not by its results: Claude Bernard, Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, ...
  - Credibility crisis, scientific integrity
- Open Science and Reproducible Research
  - Laboratory notebook
  - Computational document (jupyter, Rstudio, orgmode)
  - Version control, data management, and archiving
  - Data curation (missing data, outliers, typing issues)
  - Data visualization and hypothesis checking (Exploratory Data Analysis)
  - Communicating results
- Introduction to statistics
  - Random variables, central limit theorem, confidence interval, statistical test
  - Bayesian framework: Bayes rules, Maximum likelihood vs. Posterior sampling, Credible interval [if time allows]
  - ANOVA, Linear regression, and extensions (mostly logistic [if time allows])
  - Gaussian Process [if time allows]
- Observation vs. Experiment
  - Correlation, Causation: mostly "dont's"
  - Notions of bias (statistical, experimental, observational/sampling, etc.)
  - Metrology: measurement and tracing, precision, practical computer science issues and tools
- Experimental Design
  - Methodology (fishbone, experiment structure)
  - Difference between quantitative/qualitative observational/experimental data/analysis
  - Sequential vs. incremental approach [if time allows]
  - 2-level factorial designs, screening designs, LHS/MaxiMin designs
  - Active/online learning with bandits (\epsilon-Greedy, UCB, Thompson) and extensions (surrogates: GP-UCB, EI) [if time allows]

** 2. 02/10/25  [ AL        ] Clearly defining the experiment and having the right tools to analyze it
*** Slides and resources
1. MOOC status report and feedback on exercises.
2. We propose you to work in group on the Parallel Quicksort project.
   Do not waste your time trying to run this on windows (unless you
   use WSL). Fork this [[https://github.com/alegrand/M2R-ParallelQuicksort][project]] which is toy experiment regarding
   measuring the performance of a simple parallel quicksort
   implementation:
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       One of your colleague just implemented a multi-threaded version of
       the quicksort algorithm for multi-core machines. He's convinced his
       code can save significant time saving but unfortunately, he did not
       follow the performance evaluation lecture and he would like your
       help to promote his code.
     #+END_QUOTE
   Try to re-run this code, compare the results, and improve the
   experimental design if needed. You could for example:
   - Improve the experiment design (i.e., the number of repetitions,
     the range of parameters, the order in which they are run, ...)
   - Repeat this with various machines.
   - Make a nicer figure with ggplot
   - Improve the analysis (confidence interval, continuous trend,
     extrapolation)
   
   # - Empirical evaluation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law][Fitts's law]]: Fork this small [[https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/coutrixc/m2r_pointingxp][project]]
   #   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   #   Fitts described 1954 the relationship between the distance to a target, its width, and the time needed to acquire it [Fitts, 1954]. To aquire a target, e.g., to move the mouse cursor and click on a file to select it, Fitts' law describes how the distance between the start point and the target (A: amplitude of the movement), and the size of the target (W: width of the target) impacts the index of difficulty of the task (ID) [MacKenzie and Buxton, 1992]:

   #      ID = log2(A/W + 1)

   #   The time (MT: movement time) needed for a user to acquire a target is linearly correlated to ID:

   #       MT = a + b × ID

   #   A large part of Human-Computer Interaction research since then builds on top of Fitts' law. This project aims at finding the values of the a and b parameters.
   #   #+END_QUOTE
   #   Try to re-run this analysis, then re-obtain some data and compare
   #   the results, improve the experimental design if needed.

uncomfortable with the one you’ve been assigned; you may even pick an
other topic if you can’t trade yours but I’d like everyone to work on
different topics as much as posible). I have only quickly read through
most of these these documents so do not expect extraordinay
content. Prepare a short presentation with the pros and cons of each
technology. You will present (1) the problems it tries to address, (2)
to what extent it does, (3) whether it unlocked other
usages/problems. (4) Indicate in which of the 4th scenarios of the

* Hands-on
In the 3rd module of the [[https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/recherche-reproductible-principes-methodologiques-pour-une-science-transparente/][MOOC on Reproducible Research]], there is a
peer-reviewed homework that will allow you to practically use
everything you learnt. 
* Requirements 
All the examples given in this series of lecture use the [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] language
and the source is provided so that people can reuse them. The slides
are composed with [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]], beamer, and verbments.

It is not expected that students already knows the R language as I
will briefly present it. However, they should have already installed
Rstudio and R (check the next section if you need information) on
their laptop so as to try out the examples I provide for themselves. 

Alternatively, you may use Jupyter with python or R, either on your
machine or through the MOOC or the [[https://jupyterhub.u-ga.fr/][UGA JupyterHub]]. Most R verbs have
now their python counterpart (e.g., =numpy= and =pandas= for vectors and
dataframes, =plotnine= for =ggplot2=, =statsmodels= for linear regressions,
...).
* Using R
** Installing R, Rstudio, or Jupyter
*** R
Here is how to proceed on debian-based distributions:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt install r-base r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-dplyr r-cran-tidyr r-cran-knitr r-cran-magrittr 
#+END_SRC
Make sure you have a recent (>= 3.2.0) version or R. For example, here
is what I have on my machine:
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
R --version
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) -- "Kick Things"
Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
You are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.
For more information about these matters see
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

#+end_example
*** Rstudio
Rstudio and knitr are unfortunately not packaged within debian so the
easiest is to download the corresponding debian package on the [[http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop][Rstudio
webpage]] and then to install it manually (depending on when you do this
and on the version of your OS, *you should obviously change the version
number*).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/bionic/amd64/rstudio-2021.09.0%2B351-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i rstudio-2021.09.0+351-amd64.deb
sudo apt -f install # to fix possibly missing dependencies
#+END_SRC
# You will also need to install knitr. To this end, you should simply
# run R (or Rstudio) and use the following command.
# #+BEGIN_SRC R
# install.packages("knitr")
# #+END_SRC
If some packages like =r-cran-ggplot2= or =r-cran-reshape= could not be installed for some
reason, you can also install it through R by doing:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("ggplot2")
#+END_SRC
*** Jupyter
Now regarding jupyter, here is how to proceed on a debian-based distribution:
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install jupyter r-cran-irkernel r-cran-irdisplay
#+end_src
Then you can simply run:
#+begin_src sh
jupyter notebook
#+end_src

If you want a cooler Jupyter environment, [[https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html][install JupyterLab]], for example as follows:
#+begin_src sh
pip3 install jupyterlab
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME
jupyter lab
#+end_src

** Producing documents
The easiest way to go is probably to [[http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown][use R+Markdown (Rmd files) in
Rstudio]] and to export them via [[http://www.rpubs.com/][Rpubs]] to make available [[http://www.rpubs.com/tucano/zombies][whatever you
want]].

We can roughly distinguish between three kinds of documents:
1. Lab notebook (with everything you try and that is meant mainly
   for yourself)
2. Experimental report (selected results and explanations with
   enough details to discuss with your advisor)
3. Result description (rather short with only the main point and,
   which could be embedded in an article)
We expect you to provide us the last two ones and to make them
publicly available so as to allow others to [[http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/ratmog11][comment]] on them.
** Learning R
For a quick start, you may want to look at [[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf][R for Beginners]]. A probably
more entertaining way to go is to follow a good online lecture
providing an introduction to R and to data analysis such as this one:
https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata. 

A quite effective way (if you have time) is to use [[http://swirlstats.com/students.html][SWIRL]], an
interactive learning environment that will guide through self-paced
lesson.
#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
install_from_swirl("R Programming")
swirl()
#+end_src
I suggest in particular to follow the following lessons from R
programming (max 10 minutes each):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 1: Basic Building Blocks      2: Workspace and Files

  This is an easy-to-read self-content book for practical performance
  evaluation. The numerous checklists make it a great book for
  engineers and every CS experimental scientist should have read it.

  A short book suited for brief presentations. I follow a similar
  organization but I really don't like the content of this book. I
  feel it provides very little insight on why the theory applies or
  not. I also think it is too general and lacks practical examples. It
  may be interesting for those willing a quick and broad presentation
  of the main concepts and "recipes" to apply.

  A very good book, with a much more theoretical treatment than the
  Jain. It goes way farther on many aspects and I can only recommand
  it.

  This is a good and thorough textbook on design of experiments. It's
  so unfortunate it relies on "exotic" softwares like JMP and minitab
  instead of R...

  This book is derived from material that Pr. Faraway used in a Master
  level class on Statistics at the University of Michigan. It is
  mathematically involved but presents in details how linear
  regression, ANOVA work and can be done with R. It works out many
  examples in details and is very pleasant to read. A must-read if you
  want to understand this topic more thoroughly.

  A short nice book summarizing the main steps of the scientific
  method and why having a clear definition is not that simple. It
  illustrates these points with several nice historical examples that
  allow the reader to take some perspective on this epistemological
  question.
